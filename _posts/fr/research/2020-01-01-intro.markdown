> Neural interfaces are information technology systems that interact directly with the human nervous system to control a computer, machine or connect to the internet.
They can be non-invasive, picking up signals through electrodes placed outside the body, or invasive, breaking the skin or skull barrier to implant electrodes directly into the brain or peripheral nervous system.

The Mental Work Research Platform offers a unique opportunity to explore the myriad possibilities of designing and testing new neural interfaces by creating user-centric models for neural interfaces based on user experience design. The overarching research direction is to explore how different neural interface designs can enhance a feeling of embodiment in the user: How can we improve on the sense of “being part of the machine” to augment control? Equally important is an empirical exploration of the ethical concerns that neural interfaces evoke.
